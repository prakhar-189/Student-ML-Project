# 🎓 Student Marks Predictor

An end-to-end regression ML application that predicts a student's **math score** from demographic and academic features. It pairs a clean, modular training pipeline with **MLflow experiment tracking**, an automated **test + CI** workflow, a **Dockerized Flask service** (HTML form + JSON API), and an AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployment.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The project demonstrates a realistic ML workflow: ingest structured student data, build a reusable preprocessing pipeline, tune and compare several regression models with cross-validation, track every experiment in MLflow, serialize the winning model, and serve it behind a Flask web app and JSON API. Training is fully separated from inference so the deployed service stays lightweight.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Regression-based score prediction** from gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, test-prep course, and reading/writing scores.
- **Reusable preprocessing pipeline** — median imputation + standard scaling for numeric features, most-frequent imputation + one-hot encoding for categoricals (`ColumnTransformer`), serialized as `preprocessor.pkl`.
- **Model selection done right** — five regressors tuned with `GridSearchCV`, the winner chosen by **cross-validated R²** (never by peeking at the test set), with train/test R² tracked to surface over-fitting.
- **MLflow experiment tracking** — every model's params and cv/train/test R² are logged and comparable in the MLflow UI.
- **Web app + JSON API** — a Flask form (`/predictdata`) with input validation and a JSON endpoint (`POST /predict`) for programmatic use, served by Gunicorn.
- **Tested & linted in CI** — `pytest` + `ruff` run on every push/PR via GitHub Actions.
- **Containerized** — a `Dockerfile` runs the whole service anywhere.
- **Modular pipeline** — Data Ingestion → Data Transformation → Model Training → Prediction, with custom logging and exceptions.

## 📊 Model Performance

Five regressors were tuned with `GridSearchCV` (cv=3) on an 80/20 split of 1,000 records. The winner is selected by **cross-validated R²**; test R² is reported once for the selected model.

| Model | CV R² | Train R² | Test R² |
|-------|:-----:|:--------:|:-------:|
| **Linear Regression** ✅ | **0.865** | 0.874 | **0.880** |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.852 | 0.894 | 0.873 |
| Random Forest | 0.832 | 0.976 | 0.852 |
| AdaBoost | 0.826 | 0.847 | 0.848 |
| Decision Tree | 0.713 | 1.000 | 0.729 |

**Selected model: Linear Regression** — it has the best cross-validated score *and* generalizes best (test R² 0.880). Note how Decision Tree (train 1.000 / test 0.729) and Random Forest (train 0.976) memorize the training data — exactly the over-fitting that CV-based selection guards against.

_Reproduce these numbers with `python -m src.pipeline.train_pipeline` and inspect the runs with `mlflow ui`._

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Python 3.11** · **Flask** + **Gunicorn** · **scikit-learn** · **Pandas/NumPy** · **MLflow** · **pytest** + **ruff** · **Docker** · **GitHub Actions** · **AWS Elastic Beanstalk / CodePipeline / CodeBuild**

---

## ▶️ Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Setup
python -m venv venv && venv\Scripts\activate      # (Linux/macOS: source venv/bin/activate)
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt

# 2. (Optional) Retrain — writes artifacts/ and logs runs to MLflow
python -m src.pipeline.train_pipeline
mlflow ui                                          # view experiments at http://localhost:5000

# 3. Run the web app
python app.py                                      # http://localhost:5000
```

### JSON API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"gender":"male","race_ethnicity":"group C","parental_level_of_education":"some college","lunch":"standard","test_preparation_course":"completed","reading_score":74,"writing_score":71}'
# -> {"math_score": 74.69}
```

Invalid input returns a `400` with a clear error message instead of leaking a stack trace.

### Run the checks

```bash
ruff check .
pytest -q
```

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t student-marks-predictor .
docker run -p 5000:5000 student-marks-predictor
```

## ☁️ Deployment & CI/CD

The app is deployment-ready for **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**, wired to **GitHub → CodePipeline → CodeBuild → Elastic Beanstalk** (`buildspec.yml`, `.ebextensions/`, `Procfile`) for automatic deployment on push. A separate GitHub Actions workflow (`ci.yml`) lints and tests every change.

> ℹ️ A public AWS demo URL may be intermittently offline, since the hosting resources can be torn down to avoid ongoing cloud costs. The app runs identically via `python app.py` or Docker.
